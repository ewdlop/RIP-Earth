# Geodesics

How can geodesics be used in hyperbolic spaces?

And How can there be any geodesics in hyperbolic spaces(curve)?

"it is not touching" and so it is not definable. 

# Curvatures

Here are some useful resources and examples related to differential geometry:

1. [Differential geometry - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry): This article provides a comprehensive overview of differential geometry, including concepts such as Riemannian geometry, symplectic geometry, and various applications.

2. [Real-Life Applications of Differential Geometry](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/real-life-applications-of-differential-geometry/): This article explains how differential geometry is used to study surfaces in three-dimensional space, such as spheres, cylinders, and cones, and introduces concepts like Gaussian curvature and geodesics.

3. [Introduction to Differential Geometry - University of Toronto](https://www.math.toronto.edu/laithy/3672021/DiffGeomNotes_short.pdf): This PDF provides lecture notes on differential geometry, covering topics such as differential forms, normal forms for constant rank maps, flows of vector fields, and Frobenius' theorem.

4. [INTRODUCTION TO DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY - ETH Z](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~salamon/PREPRINTS/diffgeo.pdf): This document introduces the foundational concepts used in differential geometry, including a brief historical introduction and explanations of the extrinsic versus intrinsic viewpoints.

5. [Math 162A - Introduction to Differential Geometry](https://www.math.uci.edu/~ndonalds/math162a/curves.pdf): These lecture notes from a course at the University of California, Irvine, provide examples and definitions, such as tangent vectors and their applications to curves like helices.

These resources should give you a good starting point for understanding and exploring differential geometry.

Everoyne likes pizza. Have you try New York favor? I like Dominones pizza lolllllllllllll

(School Pizza doesnt have any vegetable and they were frozen and is meant for serving like a buffet so they were design to feed calories for the most part)

Damn it I should go for the salads...

TOMATO vegatle vs fruit.....

OH GOOD WHY OH GOD
